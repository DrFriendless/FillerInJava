Since 1.01
----------

 * Added 'inc' to 'other' directory. This is the code header you include
   to say that the code is released under GPL.
 * Removed resources_de.properties, resources_fr.properties, as I wrote them
   and they were pretty bad.
 * Added sortByRandom() to PlayerWrappers.
 * Added 'build.xml' to 'other'. This is for use with ant.
 * Cleaned up some access privileges on some fields, cleaned up some bad identifiers.
 * Added Kris Verbeeck's RemotePlayer.

Since 1.0
---------

 * Added INTERNATIONALISATION file.
 * Added 'filler.spec' to 'other' directory.
 * Removed erroneous line from resources.properties
 * Changed filler script to pass extra parameters through to Java
 * Changed filler script to pass LANG variable as user language.
 * Modified Filler.java to work around a bug in Sun's JDK1.3 for Linux,
   where the default locale was always en_US no matter what the user.language
   setting was. Filler now uses a method similar to that in the Locale class to
   figure out what the locale should be.
 * Fixed bug where player descriptions were not i18ned correctly.
 * Added Finnish translation by Sini Ruohomaa.
 * Added Russian translation by Alexei Sinitsyn.
