If you would like to help with the internationalisation of Filler, here is
what is needed. Please forgive me if this document tells you things you
already know, but I am writing for people who have never encountered Java
internationalisation before.

 * translate res/friendless/games/filler/resources.properties
   The string to be translated is the right hand side of the = sign.
   These strings appear in the user interface, so you can test your
   translation by running the game and seeing whether it looks right.
   If you can't figure out where a string is used, please ask me and I
   will find it in the source code. I have intentionally put the names of
   the robot players in that file so they can be translated to localised
   names. Note that many of the names are not English names anyway, as I
   have tried to give them an international flavour.

 * translate res/friendless/games/filler/help/en/*.html. The 'en' in the
   path name is a Java locale specifier, so 'en' means English. Similarly
   'fr' is French and 'de' is German. The game looks up the current locale,
   looks for a directory of the same name, and uses files in that directory
   if they exist. If you don't know the correct code, ask me or just make
   something up and I will fix it when I package the game. It is best to
   retain the same names for the files, as they are referred to from the code.
   If you don't have time to translate the HTML documentation, I will get
   Babelfish to do it, which could be quite funny.
