Thanks to Alexander Vikulin for writing the original (Windows) version
of Filler. I wrote this version to study the robot algorithms, and to
try to find a worthy opponent. I also wrote it to prove that Java is
fast enough for complex algorithms and complex games.

Please look at the INSTALL file for installation tips.
Please look at the HACKER file for ideas for developers.
