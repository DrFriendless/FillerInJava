You can play tournaments when you want the robot players to play amongst themselves,
or if you simply want to assert your authority over them.

to the form of the tournament.
The Continuous checkbox lets you choose that once a tournament has finished, a new
one starts immediately.
The Description panel gives you a brief summary of the tournament rules.

The second column is the list of players selected to play in the tournament.
The players are ordered in descending order of rating.
Initially, all players are selected.

The third column contains a Description panel, describing the player last selected
or deselected in the Players list.
