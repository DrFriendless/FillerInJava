<LI>Firstly I'd like to thank Alexander Vikulin who wrote the original
Windows version of Filler.
Check out his new site at
<A HREF="http://www.vog.ru">http://www.vog.ru</A>, or the Windows Filler
site at <A HREF="http://www.rinet.ru:8083/filler/">http://www.rinet.ru:8083/filler/</A>.
<LI>I would like to give credit for whoever drew the icons that I
poached and hacked, but I downloaded them years ago and have no idea
where I got them from.
The icon for Hugo and Shirley came from GnobotsII.
<LI>Tognon Stefano wrote the first version of the spec file used to make the
RPM package, and gave me very good instructions on how to do it myself.
<LI>Sini Ruohomaa did the Finnish translation, and provided lots of feedback on bugs and
things I could do to make translated versions work properly.
