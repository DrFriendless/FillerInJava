If you are wondering how to work the user interface, please see

This page tells you what you are supposed to be achieving to win.
<P>
Filler is quite a simple game.
There are two players, one of whom starts at the hex marked 'L' and
the other of whom starts at the hex marked 'R'.
Each take turns to choose a colour.
When you choose a colour, all of your hexes change to that colour.
"Your hexes" are those which are the same colour, and joined to, your starting
hex.
When you change colour, some of the neighbouring hexes, which are of the new
colour, will become the same colour as, and joined to, your starting hex, so
your score will increase.
Your score is the number of hexes you control.
<P>
The winner is the first player to control more than half the hexes.
As there are 1377 hexes, you need a score of 689 to win.
