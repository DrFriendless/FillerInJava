For the sumo-impaired, here is a translation of the ranking levels used.
The rankings will probably be changed when there are more human and robot
players, and someone can suggest a better set of names.
The levels for the rankings do not match those suggested by Arpad Elo.
They will eventually be set so that there are roughly equal numbers of players
in the jonidan to juryo ranks.
