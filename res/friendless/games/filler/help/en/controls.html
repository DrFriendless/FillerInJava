If you need to know what you are supposed to achieve in the game, please
see <A HREF="howtoplay.html">How To Play</A>.
This page tells you how to work the user interface.
Note: clicking on the hexes does nothing, click on the coloured buttons.

<H2>Starting A Game</H2>
To start a game, choose a player from the left hand list, e.g. Human.
Choose a player from the right hand list, e.g. Shirley or Hugo.
If you have a human opponent, choose Human from the right hand list as well.
Click on the 'Play' button to start the game.
The playing board is filled with random colours.
When it's your turn, you can choose a colour by clicking on one of the
coloured buttons, or by typing the corresponding number.

<H2>Cancelling A Tournament</H2>
The Cancel button cancels a tournament.
It does not cancel a game. 
This is to stop cheating where you run away from a game you are about to
lose!
If you really want to do that, kil the program and start again, that's your
punishment for being a coward!
For more details on tournaments, see
<A HREF="tournaments.html">Tournaments</A>.

read the help.
