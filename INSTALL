In the top directory (same directory as this file), run 'make'. That will
build a jar file for you. You then need to be super-user (root), and run
'make install'. If you can't be super-user, just do 'java -jar filler.jar'
instead.

The executable program is called 'filler', and will be installed in
/usr/local/bin. Since release 1.01, filler will use your shell variable
LANG to set the language that it runs in.
